.IP "\fBMember \fBTempestMath::Matrix3::AddRotateX\fP (F32 val)\fP" 1c
Completely untested and probably not working at all\&.  
.IP "\fBMember \fBTempestMath::Matrix3::AddRotateY\fP (F32 val)\fP" 1c
Completely untested and probably not working at all\&.  
.IP "\fBMember \fBTempestMath::Matrix3::AddRotateZ\fP (F32 val)\fP" 1c
Completely untested and probably not working at all\&.  
.IP "\fBMember \fBTempestMath::Matrix3::AddRotation\fP (F32 xVal, F32 yVal, F32 zVal)\fP" 1c
Not working at all\&. The math is wrong, and rotations are not working in general\&.
