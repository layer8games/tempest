native
.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBBy using the native access functions you assert that you know what you're doing and how to fix problems caused by using them\&. If you don't, you shouldn't be using them\&.\fP
.PP
Before the inclusion of \fBglfw3native\&.h\fP, you may define exactly one window system API macro and zero or more context creation API macros\&.
.PP
The chosen backends must match those the library was compiled for\&. Failure to do this will cause a link-time error\&.
.PP
The available window API macros are:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WIN32\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_COCOA\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_X11\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WAYLAND\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_MIR\fP
.PP
.PP
The available context API macros are:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WGL\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_NSGL\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_GLX\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_EGL\fP
.PP
.PP
These macros select which of the native access functions that are declared and which platform-specific headers to include\&. It is then up your (by definition platform-specific) code to handle which of these should be defined\&.
