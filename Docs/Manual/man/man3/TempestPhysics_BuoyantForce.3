.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A spring-like force that creates a bobbing effect, like the one experienced by a boat on water\&. It uses Hooks law to generate the amount of force based on the distance that the spring is extended\&. The base equation is: f = -k * delta * l Where delta is the distance that the spring has been moved and k is what is known as the 'spring constant', a value that represents the 'stiffness' of the spring\&. For our terms, the equation will look like this: f = -k(l - l^0) Where l is the location of the end of the spring, and l^0 is the reseting position of the spring\&. Since this is a Vector4 force, the Vector4 version of the law looks like this: f = -l(|d| - l^0)^d Where |d| is the magnitude or length of d, which is distance away from l^0 our spring now is, and ^d is a unit Vector4 version of d\&. Also: d = xA - xB Where xA is the position of the spring attached to our object, and xB is the end of the spring\&. Usage: The force generator cannot be re-used\&. For each unique spring-like force we need to have its own Spring like force\&. Each spring-like force is created with a pointer to the object at the other end of the spring, the length of the spring, and the spring constant\&. This then must be registered with a ForceRegistry*\&. Using depth, volume, height and desity of hypothetical liquid, it will generate a force to push an object up\&.
