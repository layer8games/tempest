.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A wrapper around the main engine functions\&. 

The KillerEngine class is designed to be the interface to starting up the Engine\&. This class will really just be a function and instance holder for other classes in the engine, but will actually do very little of its own\&.
.PP
A lot of the functions that will be here will not be required to use in order to use the engine\&. They will be present as helper classes, not intended for required use\&.
.PP
This is not free to use, and cannot be used without the express permission of KillerWave\&.
